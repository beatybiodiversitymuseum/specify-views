# Specify Views 
This repository serves two purposes:

1. Store all xml views used in the museum's Specify 7 instance.
2. Allowing issues to be raised using a pre-determined template for forms to be shifted.

This is a public repository so that other museums wishing to use our xml templates may do so, and so that anyone using our forms may request for fields to be added, removed, or changed. When creating an issue for a change, please follow the template given, as this helps understand the change better and implement it faster.
